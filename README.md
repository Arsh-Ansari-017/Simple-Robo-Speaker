A Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with computer systems or software by typing commands into a terminal. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), CLIs offer faster execution, greater precision, and enhanced control, making them ideal for developers, automation, and advanced system tasks.
